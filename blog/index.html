            <h2>The Truth About Why Most Couples Never Talk About Sex—It's Not Fear, It's Confusion</h2>
            <p class="post-excerpt">Most people don't know what they want. Or what's wrong. Or how to even begin. It's not that they're scared to talk. It's that they have no idea what to say.</p>
