      <div class="post-content">
        <p>You've tried asking. It didn't work.</p>

        <p>"What do you want?" gets you a shrug. "Is there anything you'd like to try?" gets you "I don't know, whatever you want." "Are you happy with our sex life?" gets you "yeah, it's fine" in a tone that tells you nothing.</p>

        <p>So you stop asking. Not because you don't care, but because the questions aren't working. And after enough non-answers, the whole exercise starts to feel pointless.</p>

        <p>It's not. You're just asking the wrong questions.</p>

        <h2>Why "What Do You Want?" Fails</h2>

        <p>Research on sexual communication found that partners report knowing only 62% of what their partners find sexually pleasing and just 26% of what their partners find displeasing. That's a massive knowledge gap. And it's not because people are hiding information. It's because the standard questions don't help them access it.</p>

        <p>"What do you want?" is too broad. It requires your partner to have a fully formed answer ready to deliver on command. Most people don't. Desire is often vague, contextual, and hard to articulate, especially when put on the spot.</p>

        <p>The question also carries implicit pressure. It sounds like "tell me the thing that will fix this." That's a lot of weight for one answer to carry.</p>

        <p>Better questions are specific enough to be answerable, open enough to invite honesty, and low-stakes enough that nobody feels like they're being evaluated.</p>

        <h2>The Five Questions</h2>

        <p><strong>1. "What was the last time we had sex that really worked for you? What made it different?"</strong></p>

        <p>This is retrospective and concrete. She doesn't have to imagine some hypothetical ideal. She just has to remember a specific experience and identify what stood out. The answers are usually more honest and more useful than anything abstract. You'll hear things like "you weren't rushing" or "we'd been laughing all evening" or "you touched me differently that time." That's actionable.</p>

        <p><strong>2. "Is there something we used to do that you miss?"</strong></p>

        <p>People are better at recognizing what they've lost than articulating what they want. This question sidesteps the difficulty of inventing desires from scratch and instead asks her to scan the past. It also communicates something important: you're paying attention to the history of your intimacy, not just the current state.</p>

        <p><strong>3. "When during the day do you feel most connected to me? Least?"</strong></p>

        <p>This one isn't about sex at all, on the surface. But research on daily sexual communication found significant associations between perceived communication quality and daily sexual satisfaction. Connection and desire are linked. Understanding when she feels closest to you reveals the conditions that make desire possible. And understanding when she feels most distant reveals what's blocking it.</p>

        <p><strong>4. "Is there anything I do during sex that you'd rather I didn't?"</strong></p>

        <p>This is the hardest question to ask and the most valuable one. Remember: partners know only 26% of what their partner finds displeasing. That means there's a 74% chance she's tolerating something she doesn't enjoy and hasn't told you about it.</p>

        <p>This question gives her explicit permission to name the negatives. Frame it casually. Don't make it heavy. And when she answers, don't get defensive. Just listen.</p>

        <p><strong>5. "If we could change one thing about how we are together physically, not just sex, what would it be?"</strong></p>

        <p>Couples with well-developed knowledge of each other's inner world are significantly more likely to report satisfaction in their sexual relationship. This question expands the conversation beyond the bedroom. Maybe she wants more non-sexual touch. Maybe she wants you to kiss her when you come home. Maybe she wants to fall asleep tangled up instead of on opposite sides of the bed.</p>

        <p>These answers often matter more than anything about technique.</p>

        <h2>How to Ask Without Making It Weird</h2>

        <p>Don't sit her down for a formal conversation. That turns it into an event, and events create pressure.</p>

        <p>Instead, ask one question at a time. In a relaxed moment. Maybe in bed after a good night. Maybe on a drive. Maybe over a glass of wine when neither of you is distracted.</p>

        <p>And here's the part most men skip: after she answers, don't fix anything. Don't problem-solve. Don't defend yourself. Just say "thank you for telling me that" and let the information land.</p>

        <p>The goal isn't to resolve everything in one conversation. The goal is to make these conversations easy enough that they keep happening.</p>

        <h2>The Shift</h2>

        <p>You don't need to become a mind reader. You need to become a better question-asker.</p>

        <p>The right questions, asked at the right time, with the right tone, unlock more honesty than years of vague "are you happy?" check-ins. They show her that you're genuinely curious, not just performing concern.</p>

        <p>Ask one this week. Just one. See what she says. You might be surprised how much she's been waiting to tell you.</p>
