        <p>Nobody tells you this when you commit to someone. There's no orientation meeting. No pamphlet explaining what's about to happen to your sex life over the next five, ten, twenty years.</p>

        <p>But the trajectory is remarkably consistent. Not identical couple to couple, but patterned enough that researchers can map it. And once you see the map, you can figure out where you are on it.</p>

        <p>Most couples are stuck in a specific stage and don't realize it's a stage. They think it's the destination.</p>

        <p>It's not.</p>

        <h2>Stage 1: Discovery</h2>

        <p>You remember this one. Everything was electric.</p>

        <p>Sex was frequent because desire was automatic. You didn't have to think about initiating. You didn't negotiate or schedule. You just wanted each other, and that wanting felt effortless.</p>

        <p>This is the neurochemical honeymoon. Dopamine flooding your system in response to novelty. Every touch was a first. Every encounter held genuine unpredictability. Your brain was in full exploration mode, and it rewarded you lavishly for it.</p>

        <p>Research on sexual desire and relationship duration confirms what you already know intuitively: desire is highest in the early stages and declines as duration increases. The inverse relationship between time together and sexual desire is one of the most replicated findings in the field.</p>

        <p>Here's what people get wrong about this stage: they think it's the real thing and everything after is the decline. But the Discovery phase isn't the peak of your sex life. It's the tutorial. It feels amazing, but it requires zero skill, zero effort, and zero self-knowledge. Your brain was doing all the work.</p>

        <h2>Stage 2: The Plateau</h2>

        <p>This is where most couples live. And most don't know it.</p>

        <p>The Plateau looks like this: sex still happens, but it's settled into a routine. Same general patterns, same initiation dynamics, same positions, same outcome. Nothing is broken. Nothing is particularly exciting, either.</p>

        <p>Frequency has dropped. You've both noticed but neither of you has made a big deal about it. You might chalk it up to being busy, or tired, or just "how things go" in a long relationship. There's an unspoken agreement to not examine it too closely.</p>

        <p>A large longitudinal study found that roughly 65% of couples maintain high stable relationship satisfaction over time, while about 19% show a declining trajectory. The key differentiator? Baseline communication quality. Couples who communicated well from the start stayed stable. Those who didn't, drifted.</p>

        <p>The Plateau isn't painful enough to force action. That's its danger. You're not fighting about sex. You're not miserable. You're just... coasting. And coasting feels like stability until you realize it's actually slow erosion.</p>

        <p>Shit gets comfortable. And comfortable becomes the enemy of growth without you ever making a conscious choice about it.</p>

        <h2>Stage 3: The Drift</h2>

        <p>This is where it gets serious.</p>

        <p>In the Drift, one or both partners have mentally checked out of the sexual relationship. Sex is rare. When it happens, it's perfunctory, an obligation fulfilled rather than a connection made. Initiation has become so fraught with anticipated rejection that one partner has stopped trying. The other has stopped noticing.</p>

        <p>The Drift doesn't always look dramatic. Sometimes it's quiet. You're still affectionate. You still like each other. But the sexual dimension of the relationship has gone dormant, and neither person knows how to restart it.</p>

        <p>Desire hasn't disappeared. It's been suppressed by a cycle of avoidance. He stopped initiating because it felt like rejection. She stopped being receptive because his initiations felt disconnected from any broader intimacy. Both withdrew, and the gap widened.</p>

        <p>Research on long-term desire confirms that these declines are driven by habituation, routine, and the absence of novelty. But critically, it also shows that the declines are not irreversible. They're responsive to intervention. The couples who reverse the Drift are the ones who recognize it as a stage, not a sentence.</p>

        <h2>Where You're Probably Stuck</h2>

        <p>If you're reading this, you're almost certainly in Stage 2.</p>

        <p>Stage 1 people don't read articles about sex. They're too busy having it. Stage 3 people have often disengaged enough that they're not seeking information, or they've already started looking at bigger interventions like therapy or separation.</p>

        <p>Stage 2 is the sweet spot for change, and here's why: the infrastructure is still intact. You still have a functioning relationship. You still have goodwill. The patterns haven't calcified into resentment yet. You're just stuck in a groove that's slowly wearing deeper.</p>

        <p>The mistake Stage 2 couples make is assuming the Plateau is permanent. That this is just what sex looks like after a few years. That the slow downward slope is gravity and you can't fight gravity.</p>

        <p>But the research says otherwise. The 17% of couples in that longitudinal study who showed a "low-but-increasing" trajectory proved something important: the direction can change. Satisfaction can go up. But it requires deliberate intervention, not passive hope.</p>

        <h2>The Shift</h2>

        <p>The three stages aren't a death sentence. They're a map.</p>

        <p>Once you know where you are, you can make a choice. You can accept the Plateau as the ceiling and watch it slowly become the Drift. Or you can recognize it for what it is: a specific, identifiable stage with specific, evidence-based exits.</p>

        <p>The Discovery phase was a gift. It required nothing from you. Everything after it requires everything from you.</p>

        <p>That's not a tragedy. That's an invitation.</p>
