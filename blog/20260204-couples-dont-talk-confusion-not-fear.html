      <div class="post-content">
        <p>The conventional wisdom goes like this: couples don't talk about sex because they're afraid. Afraid of rejection. Afraid of judgment. Afraid of rocking the boat.</p>

        <p>And yes, fear plays a role. But after enough conversations with men in long-term relationships, I've come to believe fear is the secondary problem.</p>

        <p>The primary problem is simpler and more frustrating: most people don't know what they want. Or what's wrong. Or how to even begin.</p>

        <p>It's not that they're scared to talk. It's that they have no idea what to say.</p>

        <h2>The Confusion Nobody Admits</h2>

        <p>Think about the last time you felt like your sex life was "off."</p>

        <p>Could you articulate exactly what was missing? Could you point to specific things your partner was doing (or not doing) that were contributing to the problem? Could you separate what you wanted more of from what you wanted less of?</p>

        <p>Probably not. And that's not a personal failing—it's how most people experience sexual dissatisfaction. It arrives as a vague fog, not a clear signal.</p>

        <p>You might feel "less connected." You might notice you're not initiating as much. You might sense that something's different, but you can't name it. And when you can't name it, you can't talk about it. So you don't.</p>

        <p>Therapists call this "low sexual awareness"—the inability to identify your own preferences, arousal patterns, and sources of satisfaction with any precision. It's shockingly common, even among people with decades of sexual experience.</p>

        <h2>Why Confusion Beats Fear</h2>

        <p>Fear at least has a clear object. You know what you're scared of, even if you're not ready to confront it.</p>

        <p>Confusion has no object. You don't know what you don't know. And that's paralyzing in a different way.</p>

        <p>Consider the man who senses distance in his relationship but can't figure out if the issue is:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Frequency?</li>
          <li>Variety?</li>
          <li>Connection?</li>
          <li>Something his partner is feeling but hasn't said?</li>
          <li>Something he's feeling but hasn't examined?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>He might avoid bringing it up, but not primarily because he's afraid of the conversation. He's avoiding it because he has no idea where to start. What would he even say? "Things feel weird, and I don't know why"?</p>

        <p>That's not a conversation. That's an invitation for both people to flounder.</p>

        <h2>The Knowledge Gap</h2>

        <p>Research on sexual communication reveals something striking: even in long-term relationships, partners report knowing only about 62% of what their partner finds sexually pleasurable—and only 26% of what displeases them.</p>

        <p>That's not a fear problem. That's an information problem.</p>

        <p>If you don't know what pleases your partner, how are you supposed to talk about improving things? If you're not even sure what displeases you, how can you explain it to someone else?</p>

        <p>The conversation never happens because the raw material for the conversation doesn't exist. It's not that people are too scared to speak—it's that they haven't done the work to understand what they'd say.</p>

        <h2>What Confusion Produces</h2>

        <p>When you're confused about your own experience, a few things happen.</p>

        <p><strong>You defer.</strong> You assume your partner probably knows what they want, even if they haven't said so. You wait for them to lead. They're doing the same thing.</p>

        <p><strong>You interpret silence as satisfaction.</strong> Neither of you brings anything up, so you both assume things are fine. Meanwhile, vague dissatisfaction simmers under the surface.</p>

        <p><strong>You conflate the absence of complaints with the presence of connection.</strong> You're not fighting about sex, so it must be good, right?</p>

        <p>This is how couples end up years into a relationship with no shared vocabulary for what they want, no framework for talking about it, and no idea that the other person feels the same low-grade confusion.</p>

        <h2>The Way Out</h2>

        <p>The antidote to confusion isn't courage. It's clarity.</p>

        <p>You have to do the internal work before you can do the relational work. That means:</p>

        <p><strong>Getting specific about your own experience.</strong> Not "things feel off," but "I've noticed I feel more connected when X and less connected when Y." This takes introspection. It requires paying attention.</p>

        <p><strong>Asking questions that invite specificity from your partner.</strong> Not "are you happy with our sex life?" (a yes/no trap), but "what's one thing you'd want more of?" or "when do you feel most connected to me physically?"</p>

        <p><strong>Building a shared vocabulary over time.</strong> You're not going to solve this in one conversation. The goal is to develop, together, a way of talking about intimacy that gets more precise as you practice it.</p>

        <p>This is where tools can help—whether it's a simple check-in ritual, a journal, or an app that prompts reflection. Anything that forces you to move from vague impressions to articulate observations.</p>

        <h2>The Shift</h2>

        <p>The narrative that couples don't talk about sex because they're scared is convenient. It implies you just need more courage.</p>

        <p>But courage without clarity is just awkwardness. You can force yourself to have the conversation, but if you don't know what you're trying to say, it won't go anywhere.</p>

        <p>Start with the confusion. Name it. Work to understand your own experience with more precision. Then, when you finally do talk, you'll have something real to say.</p>
